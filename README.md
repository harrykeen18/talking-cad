## Talking CAD

I want to build things like IRONMAN! Using a mouse to 3D models things is very tiresome and frankly so twenty fifteen. So talking cad lets you speak commands that get converted in to `.ucf` [Ultimate_CAD_Format](https://github.com/harrykeen18/ultimate-cad-format)

A `.ucf` loader can then be used to visualise your commands.
