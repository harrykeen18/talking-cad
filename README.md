## Talking CAD

I want to build thing like IRONMAN! Using a mouse to 3D models things is very tiresome and frankly so twenty fifteen. So talking cad lets you speak commands that get converted in to `.ucf` [(Ultimate_CAD_Format)][https://github.com/harrykeen18/ultimate-cad-format]

A `.ucf` loader can then be used to visualise your commands.
